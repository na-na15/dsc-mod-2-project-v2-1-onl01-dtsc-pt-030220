# Module 2 Final Project


## Introduction

Recently, by growing technology companies in WA, buying a house is one of the most challenging tasks for people. There are many features which are directly or indirectly affect house prices. In this project, I am evaluating some of these features and their effects on sale prices during 2014 through 2015 in King County, Washington state, and create a model for predicting future prices. I’ve used the data from Kaggle. There are over 21,000 records with 21 columns. 

## Methodology
I’ve used the OSEMiN data science workflow, which involves:
* **Obtain** (import the data)
* **Scrub** (clean the data, deal with missing values and data types)
* **Explor** (answer descriptive questions using EDA)
* **Interpret** (comment on our model and findings)
After loading the data, I first examined the data type of some columns, then discovered and corrected the incorrect data, and predicted the missing data. Then I am going to look at the relation between data, deal with outliers and normalize them. Pearson correlation is one of the tools to find the linear relationship between continues variable. And then I look at the effect of continuous variables on price. And then I remove the missing data from the data. In the last step, I find the appropriate linear model and evaluate it.
